# RPSRPG
I have a lot of free time and I got bored. 
I have a TODO in the code, but here it is:

 DONE 1. AI generated Roshambo game
 
 DONE 2. 1 player option
 
 DONE 3. 2 player option
 
 FUCKED 4. OPTIONAL GUI
 
 WIP 5. RPG Aspects
 
  WIP A. Health and Damage
 
  B. Bonuses against each other ex. rock stronger than paper 
 
  C. Critical hits

Once I finish step 5, I might go back to step 4. I also may go back and add lizzard spock or do some LAN fights.
